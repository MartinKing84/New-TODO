# Android TODO application: using google room database persistence library
Why Room over SQLITE?
 * compile-time verification of raw SQL queries
 * no need of updating queries on DB schema changes
 * less boilerplate code
 * more clean code architecture

## A simple demonstration of room library implementation

### Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TankRaj/TODO_Room.git
``````

Now import the project in android studio and modify as per your requirements.

**Happy Coding!!! :smile:**
